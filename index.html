        <div class="aboutcontent">
            <p>Kentucky Fried Chicken (KFC), a globally recognized fast-food chain, was founded by Harland Sanders in
                the 1930s when he began selling fried chicken from his roadside restaurant in Corbin, Kentucky, during
                the Great Depression.
                Sanders developed a unique blend of 11 herbs and spices for his chicken, a recipe that remains a closely
                guarded secret and is said to be stored in a vault at KFC's headquarters in Louisville, Kentucky.
                The first KFC franchise opened in Utah in 1952, marking the official start of the company's franchising
                model, which became a key driver of its rapid expansion.</p>
